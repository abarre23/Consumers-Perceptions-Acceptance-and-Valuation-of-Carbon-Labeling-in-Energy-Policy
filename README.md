This working paper uses a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework to examine U.S. consumer intention to shift household electricity use in response to hourly carbon labeling. Building on an extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the study incorporates environmental concern, environmental knowledge, attitudes toward carbon transparency, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Using a national survey (N ≈ 487) deployed through CloudResearch, the analysis evaluates both direct and indirect pathways shaping behavioral intent, as well as the value–action gaps that limit demand-side flexibility. Results indicate that environmental concern and knowledge significantly strengthen attitudes toward carbon labeling, but perceived behavioral control is the strongest overall predictor of intention to shift load. The paper provides one of the first national-scale behavioral models for carbon labeling in the residential energy sector and offers implications for tariff design, regulatory policy, and real-time emissions communication.
